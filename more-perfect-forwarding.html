<h1 align=center>Towards more perfect forwarding</h1>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>It has been known for quite some time that the library object
factories (<code>make_unique</code>, <code>make_shared</code>, 
<code>allocator::construct</code>) don't
handle aggregates well, due to the factory functions requiring
a parenthesis-expression. There seems to be a simple and elegant fix that
provides aggregate support without any loss of current functionality;
(see the proposed resolution of <a href="http://cplusplus.github.io/LWG/lwg-active.html#2089">LWG 2089</a>) making such factories provide both
braced-initialization and direct-initialization via a trait check
for <code>is_constructible</code>.

<a name="Introduction"></a><h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
Currently, <code>allocator::construct</code> is specified as follows:
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
template <class U, class... Args>
    void construct(U* p, Args&&... args);
Effects: ::new((void *)p) U(std::forward<Args>(args)...)
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
This doesn't handle an aggregate that is initializable with
<code>U{std::forward&lt;Args&gt;(args)...}</code>. Same problem
applies to <code>make_shared</code> and <code>make_unique</code>.
LWG 2089 proposes a fix that allows all the current code to work,
and allows aggregates to work, too. 
</p>

<a name="SimpleSuggestion"></a><h2>Simple suggestion</h2>

<p>
The proposed resolution for LWG 2089
<ul>
<li>allows aggregates to work with the library factories.</li>
<li>adds no run-time overhead.</li>
<li>doesn't break anything (modulo expression SFINAE cases that
are broken by any change, and are unlikely to be truly broken, since
an overload that wasn't chosen previously because it wouldn't work will now
be chosen and will now work).
<li>is unlikely to significantly increase build times.</li>
<li>is trivial to implement.</li>
<li>requires no language changes.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Since it's somewhat unlikely that we will devise some magic-forwarding
language facility, I daresay I call the list above a "slam dunk", and
we should just encourage LEWG/LWG to go forward with the proposed resolution
of LWG 2089, keeping in mind that it needs to be applied to all of
<code>allocator::construct</code>, <code>make_unique</code> and 
<code>make_shared</code>. (Anything else? I can't find any others,
<code>EmplaceConstructible</code> is specified in terms of 
<code>allocator::construct</code>, so emplace cases will Just Work.
