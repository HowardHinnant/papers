<h1 align=center>Wording for Discussion about std::thread and RAII, Solution 1: Change std::thread::~thread to auto-join</h1>

<h2>Solution 1: Change std::thread::~thread to auto-join</h2>

<p>
  This solution has been previously proposed by Herb Sutter in
  <a href="http://open-std.org/JTC1/SC22/WG21/docs/papers/2013/n3636.pdf">n3636</a>. The paper contains proposed wording. As an addition, this paper will
  provide wording for a new thread type
  should be added that will not join in destructor or assignment operator,
  but will terminate instead, thus providing a migration solution for users
  who want to retain the C++11 semantics that std::thread previously had.
</p>

<p>
  In [thread.threads]/1, insert as follows:
</p>
<p>
  <blockquote>
<pre>
Header &lt;thread&gt; synopsis
  namespace std {
    class thread;
    <ins>class basic_thread;</ins>
</pre>
</blockquote>
</p>
<p>
  After [thread.thread.this], add a new section as follows:
</p>
<p>
  <blockquote>
<pre>
Class basic_thread [thread.basic_thread.class]

namespace std {
  class basic_thread {
    public:
    // types:
    class id;
    typedef implementation-defined native_handle_type; // See 30.2.3
    // construct/copy/destroy:
    basic_thread() noexcept;
    template &lt;class F, class ...Args&gt; explicit basic_thread(F&amp;&amp; f, Args&amp;&amp;... args);
    ~basic_thread() noexcept; // semantics different from std::thread
    basic_thread(const basic_thread&amp;) = delete;
    basic_thread(basic_thread&amp;&amp;) noexcept;
    explicit basic_thread(thread&amp;&amp; x) noexcept; // addition to std::thread interface
    basic_thread&amp; operator=(const basic_thread&amp;) = delete;
    basic_thread&amp; operator=(basic_thread&amp;&amp;) noexcept; // semantics different from std::thread
    basic_thread&amp; operator=(thread&amp;&amp; x) noexcept; // addition to std::thread interface
    // members:
    void swap(basic_thread&amp;) noexcept;
    bool joinable() const noexcept;
    void join();
    void detach();
    id get_id() const noexcept;
    native_handle_type native_handle(); // See 30.2.
    thread to_thread(); // addition to std::thread interface
    // static members:
    static unsigned hardware_concurrency() noexcept;
  };
}
  
  
The class basic_thread provides the same facilities as thread, and
has the same members and the same semantics, with the differences
as described below.

basic_thread constructors [thread.basic_thread.constr]

explicit basic_thread(thread&amp;&amp; x) noexcept;

  Effects: Constructs an object of type basic_thread from x, and
  sets x to a default constructed state.

  Postconditions: x.get_id() == id() and get_id() returns the value
  of x.get_id() prior to the start of construction.
  
basic_thread destructor [thread.basic_thread.destr]

~basic_thread();

  Effects: If joinable(), calls std::terminate(). Otherwise, has no effects.
  [ Note: Either implicitly detaching or joining a joinable() thread in its
  destructor could result in difficult to debug correctness (for detach)
  or performance (for join) bugs encountered only when an exception is raised.
  Thus the programmer must ensure that the destructor is never executed while
  the thread is still joinable. -end note ]

basic_thread assignment [thread.basic_thread.assign]

basic_thread&amp; operator=(basic_thread&amp;&amp; x) noexcept;
  Effects: If joinable(), calls std::terminate(). Otherwise, assigns
  the state of x to *this and sets x to a default constructed state.

  Postconditions: x.get_id() == id() and get_id() returns the value
  of x.get_id() prior to the assignment.

  Returns: *this
  
basic_thread&amp; operator=(thread&amp;&amp; x) noexcept;
  Effects: If joinable(), calls std::terminate(). Otherwise, assigns
  the state of x to *this and sets x to a default constructed state.

  Postconditions: x.get_id() == id() and get_id() returns the value
  of x.get_id() prior to the assignment.

  Returns: *this

basic_thread members [thread.basic_thread.member]

thread to_thread();

  Postconditions: *this is set to a default constructed state. The state
  of the returned object is the state *this had prior to calling this function.

  Returns: A thread object initialized from *this.
  [Drafting note: an alternative approach would be to publicly inherit
  basic_thread from thread, and let derived-to-base conversion handle
  this conversion.]
