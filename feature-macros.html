<h1 align=center>Adopt SD-6 feature macros into the C++20 working draft</h1>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>
  This paper proposes to adopt the SD-6 feature macros into the
  C++20 working draft. Merging the feature macros removes
  vendors' obstacles for implementing them, makes them more
  portable and causes no delays in vendors tracking the macros
  in their implementations.
</p>

<h2>Current implementation status</h2>

<p>
  Looking at some implementations, we notice the following:
  <ul>
    <li>gcc and libstdc++ implement both the language feature
      macros and the library feature macros fairly completely.</li>
    <li>clang implements the language feature macros, libc++
      implements fairly few of the library feature macros.</li>
    <li>msvc and its library don't implement feature macros.
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
  There are some indications that there would be a non-zero chance
  that it would be more palatable for Microsoft
  to implement the feature macros if they are provided
  in an official WG21-sanctioned document. Some of these
  indications are mentioned in <a href="http://wiki.edg.com/bin/view/Wg21toronto2017/P0697R0">the Toronto discussion notes on P0697R0</a>.
</p>

<h2>Why put it into the IS? Would not a TS be a better choice?</h2>

<p>
  A while ago, I myself thought that putting the macros
  into an IS makes no sense, because we publish an IS every
  3 years, and can put out TSes much faster. However, I realized
  that there's no particular difference; implementations can
  track IS working drafts, which we publish after every meeting,
  so there's not necessary any delay for implementations of the macros,
  and for users being able to use the macros when adopting new
  features aggressively.
</p>
<p>
  Putting the macros into a 'real' standard document makes them
  more portable, and putting them into the IS makes them the
  most portable, assuming that implementations continue
  to strive for conformance.
</p>

<h2>Why not just continue to publish a separate document and hope for
  implementations to implement them?</h2>

<p>
  As mentioned before, some vendors can justify implementing
  the macros better if they are specified in an actual standard
  document.
</p>
<p>
  I know of some users (the Qt Base module of Qt in particular)
  that use the feature macros correctly (without forking the language
  or otherwise forming an actual dialect, and without duplicating
  implementations), and seem to prefer a feature macro approach
  to testing __cplusplus (which implementations are unlikely
  to bump before they are in complete conformance) or to testing
  features in an implementation-specific manner. Having the macros
  be actually required, such testing remains simple and becomes
  (much more) portable, compared to having to check what implementation is used
  and which version of it is used.
</p>
<p>
  I have fairly little to add why we should have feature macros to begin with. When used correctly, they allow library writers and library users to aggressively opt in to C++ features before an implementation is fully conforming to a new standard version, and to do so in a much simpler manner than detecting features in implementation-specific ways. They can most likely be abused in various ways, but the
  proper ways are a clear improvement to me. The next section attempts to
  provide a mini-FAQ of the reasons why we should have feature macros
  in the IS.
</p>

<h2>Mini-FAQ</h2>

<p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      Q: Isn't the frequency of IS publications too low for feature macros in the IS to be useful?
    </p>
    <p>
      A: No, because they can be updated in every working draft.
    </p>
    <p>
      Q: But isn't it possible that feature macros are not enough? An implementation can define a feature macro but have a buggy implementation of the feature, so implementation-specific work-arounds may still be necessary.
    </p>
    <p>
      A: That may be the case, but we expect that in quite many cases, feature macros are enough, as opposed to always using implementation-specific work-arounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Q: But it doesn't make sense to put the macros into an IS. Conforming implementations will have the same values for the macros and they will implement all features, so just checking __cplusplus is enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      A: In isolation, that's all true. But before __cplusplus is bumped,
      users can write code that detects and uses some features, and that
      code will continue to work even after __cplusplus is bumped
      with no source code changes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Q: Aren't we encouraging subsetting and dialects?
    </p>
    <p>
      A: Not really. What we are encouraging is a way for implementations
      to give users a way to adopt features early in a portable way,
      in a fashion that continues to work even after __cplusplus is bumped, and of course works before it's bumped.
    </p>
    <p>
      Q: But none of this really works unless implementations provide
      feature macros early, tracking the working drafts. The only thing
      we guarantee is that a conforming implementation provides the
      IS versions of the macros.
    </p>
    <p>
      A: Correct, but as described in the previous answers, some implementations
      will track the draft macros, and (correctly-written) code written to use
      those will automatically work with implementations that didn't
      provide the draft macros but will provide the IS macros. And, again,
      that will happen without code changes on the user side. We don't
      guarantee that every implementation provides every step of a migration
      path, but we do guarantee that all of them provide the last step,
      and we know that some will provide the earlier steps, so users
      can write code that benefits automatically from the point when
      the final macros are enabled, and already reaped the benefits
      when more aggressive implementations enabled them prior to the IS.
