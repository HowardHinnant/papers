<h1 align=center>noexcept(auto), again</h1>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>
Ever since C++14 shipped, there has been occasional requests for
noexcept(auto). This paper provides some rumination hoping that
we might reconsider it for C++17.
</p>

<h2>Rumination</h2>

<p>
Vendors of generic libraries tend to find it painful that they
have to repeat the expressions in a function body in their 
noexcept-specification. When that need arises, such library
authors
</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li> REALLY mean that the noexcept-spec should be a reflection
of what's in the function body. Duplicating that code in a noexcept-spec
is laborous and error-prone, and results in very ugly code.</li>
<li>aren't particularly concerned about ABI issues - they are often
writing a function template.</li>
<li>don't believe an unconditional noexcept is the right answer in general,
since there _are_ platforms and environments on which handling bad_allocs
is reasonable and possible, and terminate is a bad answer if a piece of
code in a copy/move constructor throws.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
I can't pretend to know what the implementation burden for this feature
truly is. But one concern that has been raised by Vandevoorde was how
to handle statements and declarations, rather than expressions. Consider
</p>
<p>
<pre>
<code>
int f() noexcept(auto)
{
    X x;
    x.foo();
    x.bar();
    return 42;
}
</code>
</pre>
</p>
<p>I believe the concern was how to deduce the noexceptness of the
definition of x, including the hidden initialization expressions in it.
The question I have is whether this is any different from deciding
whether such a function can be used in a constant expression, because
the code in it may well be valid in a constant expression with the relaxed
rules in C++14.
</p>
<p>
There may certainly be concerns about overuse, misuse and abuse of
such a facility. But there are certainly cases where the bulleted
list above applies, and the resulting code would be *much* simpler
and nicer with noexcept(auto) than without it. 
</p>

<h2>The ultimate question</h2>

<p>
Do we think the valid and reasonable uses of noexcept(auto) are important 
enough that we should standardize it?
