<h1 align=center>We cannot (realistically) get rid of throwing moves</h1>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>During the reflector discussion about variant, there were suggestions
to restrict variant to types with non-throwing move assignments, and
suggestions to ban throwing move assignments in general, and perhaps
also throwing move constructors. This paper provides some thoughts
on those ideas.
</p> 
<p>
The suggested outcome is that we can't realistically
get rid of throwing move operations because they end up being more
common than people realize, easier to end up with than people realize,
and when it comes to variant, banning types that have throwing moves
will significantly and severely limit the set of user-defined types 
that can be used in a variant.
The recommendation of this paper is to not pursue such directions.
</p>

<a name="Introduction"></a><h2>Background material</h2>

<p>
The following papers provide useful background material:

<a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2009/n2983.html">N2983, Allowing Move Constructors to Throw</a>
</p>

</p>

<a name="Throwing_Move"></a><h2>What's a "throwing move"?</h2>

<p>
For constructors, a "throwing move" is not just a move constructor that is
not noexcept, it's <b>anything that causes the expression</b>
</p>
<p>
<code>
<pre>
    X(move(rhs))
</pre>
</code>
</p>
<p>
<b>to be potentially throwing</b> (aka not noexcept(true)), 
<b>including but not limited
to the move constructor of X</b>. In particular, <b>if overload resolution
ends up selecting a copy constructor to be used in that expression</b>, the
expression (very often, but not always - your type might have a non-throwing
copy constructor) is a "throwing move".
</p>
<p>
For assignment, a "throwing move" is not just a move assignment operator that is
not noexcept, it's <b>anything that causes the expression</b>
</p>
<p>
<code>
<pre>
    lhs = move(rhs)
</pre>
</code>
</p>
<p>
<b>to be potentially throwing</b> (aka not noexcept(true)), 
<b>including but not limited
to the move assignment operator of X</b>. In particular, 
<b>if overload resolution ends up selecting a copy assignment operator
to be used in that expression</b>, the expression (very often, but not
always - your type might have a noexcept copy assignment operator) 
is a "throwing move".
</p>

<a name="Is_It_Common"></a><h2>Is it common?</h2>

<p>
Let's look at a very simple example (credits to Jonathan Wakely):
</p>
<p>
<code>
<pre>
  struct X
  {
    // other value-initializing constructors left out
    X(const X&amp;);
  };
</pre>
</code>
</p>
<p>
This type has its move operations suppressed due to a user-declared
copy operation, but it can still be used in either of the expressions
we showed before when describing what is a "throwing move". It has
a "throwing move".
</p>
<p>
Here's another simple example:
</p>
<p>
<code>
<pre>
  struct X2
  {
    ~X2();
    // data members not shown, let's please assume they are 
    // either copyable or movable
  };
</pre>
</code>
</p>
<p>
This type has its move operations suppressed due to a user-declared
destructor, but it can still be used in either of the expressions
we showed before when describing what is a "throwing move". It may or
may not have a throwing move, depending on what its data members are.
When this type is used in the move expressions, the move operations
of the members of X2 will not be used, so it boils down to whether
the members of X2 have copy operations that are non-throwing. This
means that the types of the members need not be like X, all it takes
is that one of them has a <b>throwing copy operation</b>, <b>regardless
of whether it also has a non-throwing move operation</b>.
</p>
<p>
So, are such types common? You bet they are. I have written dozens
and dozens of them, and not all of them are necessarily in legacy
code. Some of that code may be new, but needs to work in pre-C++11
environments as well. My customers and users have thousands of such types.
Yours have more.
</p>

<a name="So_Can_We_Ban_Throwing_Moves"></a><h2>So can we ban throwing moves?</h2>

<p>
Ban them where?
<ul>
<li>In the Core language? If we want to create a massively incompatible 
fork of C++ below the standard version that enforces the ban, then maybe.</li>
<li>In the Standard Library? If we want to create a little less massively
but still massively incompatible 
fork of C++ below the standard version that enforces the ban, then maybe.</li>
<li>In the proposed std::variant? Maybe, but then we rule out all the aforementioned types from being used in a variant.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Let me take off the "calm and cool paper writer hat" for a second. I'll write
those bullet answers from a personal perspective, and what I'd likely suggest
the national perspective to be:
<ul>
<li>In the Core language? Have you lost your mind? It would take years to 
repair the damage. A more likely outcome is that people who have existing
code will decide to not adopt a new C++ standard, or will request from
their vendor that the vendor doesn't follow it in this regard.</li>
<li>In the Standard Library? Same answer.</li>
<li>In the proposed std::variant? Why is variant special? We already
have other less drastic options available for it, so banning all these
types from being used in variant is hardly explicable, when they can
be used in other library wrappers and containers without huge trouble.
(Yes, I can imagine what we'll explain among ourselves to be the
reason. My users will not accept that explanation, especially not
when boost::variant doesn't have such a restriction).</li>
</ul>
</p>

<a name="Copy_Instead_Of_Move"></a><h2>Wait a minute. We could just copy such types, instead of moving them, using move_if_noexcept, right?</h2>

<p>
Let's look at another example:
</p>
<p>
<code>
<pre>
  pair&lt;X, unique_ptr&lt;Foo&gt;&gt;
</pre>
</code>
</p>
<p>
This type is not copyable, because it has a move-only member. So, getting
back to the papers mentioned in the beginning, we could either choose
that it has a throwing move, or it's not copyable nor movable. If it's
not copyable nor movable, I don't think I can store it in a vector, unless
we do a lot of surgery on vector. Similar problems arise with other containers.
If we look outside the standard library, I can no longer return such
a type by value nor pass it by value. It becomes a scoped type that will
not transfer outside its scope.
</p>
<p>
There's a surprising example of a type that otherwise would be nicely
non-throw-movable, but isn't when it's suitably qualified:
</p>
<p>
<code>
<pre>
  const vector&lt;int&gt;
</pre>
</code>
</p>
<p>
That type has a throwing move.
</p>
<p>
Let's look at yet another example:
</p>
<p>
<code>
<pre>
  pair&lt;X, vector&lt;Foo&gt;&gt;
</pre>
</code>
</p>
<p>
So, perhaps this type wouldn't have move operations, and we could happily
copy it around. The problem is that one major reason why throwing moves
were allowed was that we would like to be able to move the vector even
in cases where we can't move the X. If we never move such a type,
we will then always copy it, which can never move the vector.
</p>

<a name="Making_Types_Movable"></a><h2>But some of those types can be made movable. Can't we expect that all copyable types will be made movable?</h2>

<p>
Sadly, no. Tomasz Kaminski depicted a type like the following:
</p>
<p>
<code>
<pre>
  class Employee
  {
    string name;
    string surname;
  public:
    Employee(const Employee&); // the type is copyable, moves not generated
    // the invariant of the type includes that the members aren't empty
    // initializing constructors and the rest of the interface left out
    // for brevity
  };
</pre>
</code>
</p>
<p>
The business-domain rules for such a type require that its members are not
empty. Ever. So, how do we implement a non-throwing move for it? We can't
move the strings. We can copy them, and we're back at a non-throwing
move that we already had. Similar invariants were mentioned as a concern
for generated move operations in general in
<a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2010/n3153.htm">N3153, Implicit Move Must Go</a>. We decided that the suppression rules we
have are sufficiently non-breaking, and the Employee class plays by those
rules - it protects its invariant even in C++11, and there's no generated
move operation that would break its invariant. Nor can one be reasonably
written, so requiring such a move, especially a non-throwing one, seems
unattainable.
</p>

<a name="How_Incompatible"></a><h2>So, how incompatible would the ban of throwing moves be?</h2>

<p>
Any type like X written before or while C++11 and C++14 are used would become
incompatible with the standard that enacts the ban. Same goes for the types
with a mixture of copy-only and move-only members. The period "while C+11 and
C++14 are used" may take longer than we think. Sure, the example type
that uses the aforementioned mixture can appear only after C++11 is taken into
use. But any type like X can still be used with C++11 and C++14, and
any such code would break when the ban is enacted.
</p>
<p>
I can't support a wide-effect ban. I must oppose it, as hard as I can.
For variant, I think variant becomes a much less useful type if it has
such a variant-specific ban. It becomes very hard to justify using
the standard variant instead of boost::variant, and that removes a large
part of the very good reasons why we standardize libraries. (There's
nothing wrong with using boost, but there are good reasons to use
a standard type instead of a boost type, if possible.)
