<h1 align=center>Constrained forwarding references</h1>

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>
  A declaration like void f(CopyConstructible&amp;&amp;); is not a function
  that takes a forwarding reference to a CopyConstructible type; it accepts
  an lvalue of any type, or an rvalue that is CopyConstructible. I find it
  unwise to have such a problem in the language, so this paper proposes
  to solve the problem by adding a new deduction rule so that constrained
  forwarding references will have the constraints apply to the non-reference
  type, instead of sometimes applying to that type and sometimes to
  an lvalue reference to that type.
</p>

<h2>The problem illustrated</h2>

<p>
  Casey Carter provided the following:
</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>
    Yes, constraining forwarding references is a nightmare, especially when the concept may accept both or either of T and T& with different meanings:
    <blockquote><code>
    <pre>
    void foo(CopyConstructible&amp;&amp; x) { /* ... */ }
    </pre>
    </code></blockquote>
Did the author really intend to require that x is either an rvalue reference to an object of a copy constructible type or an lvalue reference to anything? The original design for the 'structible concepts only admitted object types specifically to avoid this problem which I call "reference confusion". We eventually had to drop that design and fall back on the type traits in part because it's impossible to effectively constrain declarations using only expression requirements. 
    </p>
    <p>
      When constraining forwarding references I recommend being very careful, and avoiding terse syntax so the next person doesn't end up wondering about your intent.
      </p>
  </blockquote>

<p>
  Let's look at an example:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <pre><code>
#include &lt;type_traits&gt;

struct X {};

struct Y {Y() = default; Y(const Y&amp;) = delete;};

template &lt;class T&gt; concept bool CopyConstructible = std::is_copy_constructible_v&lt;T&gt;;
void f(CopyConstructible&amp;&amp;) {}
template &lt;CopyConstructible T&gt; void f2(T&amp;&amp;) {}
template &lt;class T&gt; void f3(T&amp;&amp;) requires CopyConstructible&lt;T&gt; {}
template &lt;class T&gt; void f4(T&amp;&amp;) requires CopyConstructible&lt;std::remove_reference_t&lt;T&gt;&gt; {}

template &lt;class T&gt; concept bool Integral = std::is_integral_v&lt;T&gt;;
void g(Integral&amp;&amp;) {}
template &lt;Integral T&gt; void g2(T&amp;&amp;) {}
template &lt;class T&gt; void g3(T&amp;&amp;) requires Integral&lt;T&gt; {}
template &lt;class T&gt; void g4(T&amp;&amp;) requires Integral&lt;std::remove_reference_t&lt;T&gt;&gt; {}

int main()
{
    X x;
    Y y;

    f(x);
    f(y); // #1
    f(X());
    //f(Y()); // the computer says no, but one could expect it would've already said no at #1

    f2(x);
    f2(y); // #2
    f2(X());
    //f2(Y()); // the computer says no, but one could expect it would've already said no at #2

    f3(x);
    f3(y); // #3
    f3(X());
    //f3(Y()); // the computer says no, but one could expect it would've already said no at #3

    f4(x);
    //(y); // ill-formed, great!
    f4(X());
    //f4Y()); // ill-formed, great!

    double a = 5.5;
    int b = 666;

    //g(a); // the computer says no
    //g(5.5); // the computer says no
    //g(b); // the computer says no, which is surprising
    g(666);

    //g2(a); // the computer says no
    //g2(5.5); // the computer says no
    //g2(b); // the computer says no, which is surprising
    g2(666);

    //g3(a); // the computer says no
    //g3(5.5); // the computer says no
    //g3(b); // the computer says no, which is surprising
    g3(666);

    //g4(a); // ill-formed, great!
    //g4(5.5); // ill-formed, great!
    g4(b);
    g4(666);
}
  </code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
  The commented-out lines are ill-formed.
</p>
<p>
  This status quo has two problems:
  <ol>
    <li>For the CopyConstructible example, the user failed
      to actually constrain the function, except for f4. For lvalues,
      the function doesn't require what the user most likely
      thinks it requires, which punches a big hole into the interface.
    </li>
    <li>For the Integral example, the user will end up being
      puzzled that the function requires more than the user
      expected. There's no hole in the interface, but there's
      a stumbling block that should not be there.
    </li>
  </ol>
</p>
<p>
  Those are, sadly, not the only problems. They are the original
  ones, but they lead to additional ones:
  <ol>
    <li>
      Such core concepts are now hard to use, and using them
      correctly will often require additional requires-clauses.
    </li>
    <li>
      Naive and simple uses are the ones that are more mistake-prone,
      whereas the longer and more complex ones make it somewhat
      easier to avoid mistakes.
    </li>
  </ol>
</p>
<p>
  We should realize that the problem also arises if we get
  constrained variables again:
<pre><code><blockquote>
void f()
{
    X x;
    Y y;
    CopyConstructible&amp;&amp; c = x;
    CopyConstructible&amp;&amp; c2 = y;
}
</blockquote></code></pre>
</p>
<p>
  Here, we can't add a convenient additional constraint.
  The only refuge is a separate static_assert.
</p>

<h2>Solution, wording</h2>

<p>
  It seems perfectly reasonable for a user to operate under a mental
  model that ConceptName&amp;&amp; is a forwarding reference to a
  constrained type. To facilitate this, we propose a new deduction rule,
  so that if a forwarding reference is constrained, the constraints
  apply to the non-reference type, not to the deduced type (which
  may be an lvalue reference). With this fix, the example's f, f2 and
  f3 work like f4, and g, g2 and g3 work like g4. The only change
  is in deduction; calls with explicit template arguments do not
  change meaning. Wording follows (thanks to Jens Maurer for the
  wording).
</p>

<p>
   Change in [over.match.viable] 16.3.2 p2 as follows:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <pre>
    Second, for a function to be viable, if it has associated constraints,
    those constraints shall be satisfied (17.4.2) <ins>with the proviso that
    any constraint referring to a template parameter T whose template
    argument was deduced from a forwarding reference as an lvalue reference
    to some type U ([temp.deduct.call] is instead taken to check
    satisfaction for U, not for "lvalue reference to U"</ins>.
  </pre>

</blockquote>

<h2>Alternatives considered but rejected</h2>

<p>
  A different way to fix the problem would be to add
  the reference removal into the concept used. That doesn't
  work for the proposed core concepts, because they need
  to be able to deal with reference types as well as non-reference
  types.
</p>

<p>
  We could also just tell users to write their own concepts
  that combine the reference removal and the use of the core
  concept. That makes the core concept less useful and doesn't
  remove the problem that it's hard to use correctly.
