<h1 align=center>Non-throwing container operations</h1>

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>
This paper explores alternatives for adding non-throwing container
operations, namely alternatives to throwing exceptions from failing
modifications.
</p>
<p>
There are various embedded environments where exceptions
are not palatable. Yet the applications written for such enviroments
are getting ever more complex, and C++ and its abstraction mechanisms
are increasingly attractive on such environments. There's an impedance
mismatch between the desire to have the environment be as close
to standard C++ as possible and not being able to afford exception
support.
</p>

<a name="Introduction"></a><h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
A fairly common example of the environments mentioned in the abstract
are systems that have at most hundreds of kilobytes of RAM. Yet in that
crammed space, device manufacturers put applications that have
network connectivity, XML support, declarative UI frameworks with
scripting, and more.
</p>
<p>
These environments often do ensure that the overall memory budget
is not overrun by utilizing fixed-size pools. There are sometimes
multiple pools so that individual module-specific pools cannot
disturb each other, but the clients of the pools do recover from
allocations failing to allocate memory from the pools.
</p>
<p>
Building without exception support for such resource-constrained systems
allows cramming much more functionality
into the system, from both the non-volatile memory point of view
and the RAM point of view. The RAM consumption is often the more important
point, as is the potentially non-deterministic handling time of thrown
exceptions.
There has been a lot of talk about
making exceptions more palatable on such resource-constrained
systems, but thus far that hasn't materialized in practice.
</p>

<a name="What"></a><h2>So what are you proposing?</h2>

<p>
In a very abstract sense, what we are proposing is adding alternative
contained modifier operations of some form so that exceptions are not
required for reporting errors. There are various ways in which that
can be done, but certain general properties are probably common
to all alternatives:
<ul>
<li>Exception support costs too much, space-wise and time-wise.</li>
<li>Dynamic memory allocations still happen, and they can fail.</li>
<li>Not every module is critical, so various strategies can be employed
to recover from allocation failures.</li>
<li>Termination is not a feasible strategy.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<a name="Why_not_terminate"></a><h3>Why not just terminate?</h3>

<p>
A fairly oft-suggested alternative is to just terminate if a failing
allocation cannot throw. That's a very drastic approach, because
many environments do not support multiple processes, so if any module
terminates, the whole system will restart after a hard abort. This
causes loss of system availability, which in some environments is
life-threatening and in some environments loses user data.
</p>

<a name="Alternatives"></a><h2>Some proposal alternatives</h2>

<a name="Return_bool"></a><h3>Simple status return</h3>

<p>
Daniel Gutson's original proposal outline just adds non-throwing
overloads to contained modifiers. Here's an example of what
such overloads for vector's push_back would look like:
<pre>
<code>
bool push_back(nothrow_t, const T&);    
bool push_back(nothrow_t, T&&);    
</code>
</pre>
The general idea is that we use a tag type to differentiate
these overloads, and since the idea is that these operations
don't throw if an allocation fails, we can just as well use
the nothrow_t we already have. The function returns a bool
signaling whether it succeeded or not. Note that the copy
operation of T may throw; that throw is not handled by these
functions. The intention is that these functions are used
with an accompanying allocator that doesn't throw on failure,
and the element type is one that has non-throwing copy/move
operations. Also note that the idea is to add such non-throwing
operations to other containers beyond vector.
</p>

<a name="Return_bool_different_name"></a><h3>Use a different function name instead</h3>

<p>
Various people suggested that since the behavior of these functions
is significantly different from the other overloads, they should
be named differently. As a strawman example, something like
<pre>
<code>
bool push_back_nothrow(const T&);    
bool push_back_nothrow(T&&);    
</code>
</pre>
</p>

<a name="Handle_failure_internally"></a><h3>A much less intrusive alternative</h3>
<p>
Howard Hinnant pointed out that adding lots of new functions or overloads
to the api of the library containers to be used by a specialized
crowd is questionable. He outlined a possible alternative:
allowing an allocator to return a nullptr and specifying the behavior
in that case. For instance, a failed push_back just wouldn't change
the size or the capacity of the vector.
</p>

<a name="Callback"></a><h3>A custom allocator with a failure callback</h3>
<p>
Howard outlined a different less intrusive approach: use an allocator
that can register a failure callback. This is fairly similar to the
previous approach in the sense that an allocator can fail without
an exception and the result behavior of the container needs to be specified,
but in addition to that, a user can set a failure callback on the allocator.
That may end up being rather intrusive if the callback type is not
erased. Erasing the type of the callback has its own problems.
</p>

<a name="Separate_container"></a><h3>Adding new specialized containers</h3>
<p>
Howard also suggested building a new container, since it's can be seen as
a fair assessment that such a difference in behavior is significant
enough that the facility should become a separate container.
</p>

<a name="What_next"></a><h2>What's next?</h2>

<p>
Before diving into detailed specification and implementation,
design guidance is necessary. The whole approach needs to go
to EWG, because the general idea of not using exceptions
for error reporting is a completely new programming model
for the library containers. Beyond that, the general design
needs to be looked at by LEWG: whether to add overloads, whether
to add new functions, whether to build new containers...
