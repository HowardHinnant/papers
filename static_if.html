<h1 align=center>Static if resurrected</h1>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>I want to bring back parts of static if; namely bring it back
in a form where it's
<ul>
<li>restricted to block scopes.</li>
<li>always going to establish a new scope.</li>
<li>required that there exists values of the condition so that
either condition branch is well-formed.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>Why? Because it allows making static decisions without
having to resort to multiple overloads. Having a static
if allows for simple and local code, without having to
know the intricacies of overload resolution, partial
ordering and SFINAE.
</p>

<a name="Introduction"></a><h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
Richard Smith explained the following:
</p>
<pre>
The "controversial" parts of N3329 are that:
1) it does not introduce a new scope, and
2) the non-selected branch is completely ignored (the tokens aren't even 
required to be parseable)

This makes it fundamentally incompatible with the template model used by at 
least two major implementations.

If, instead, it introduced a new scope (as proposed in this thread) and we had 
a requirement that it is possible to instantiate each arm of the static if 
(that is, the same requirement we have for other token sequences in templates),
then I believe the over-my-dead-body objections from implementors would disappear.
</pre>
<p>
So, the proposed static_if (perhaps we could get rid of the space,
it avoids splitting the keyword onto multiple lines. Not everyone
uses clang-format. Yes, people who don't are foolish, but anyway)
should have the characteristics Richard outlined.
</p>

<a name="Motivation"></a><h2>Motivation</h2>

<p>
As the first example, I find it unwieldy to do pack unpacking with 
multiple overloads.
</p>
<pre>
<code>
template &lt;class T&gt; 
void f(T&& t) 
{
    /* handle one T */
} 

template &lt;class T, class... Rest&gt; 
void f(T&& t, Rest&&... r) 
{
    f(t); 
    /* handle the tail */
    f(r...);
}
</code>
</pre>
<p>
It would be much simpler to be able to handle the unpacking in one
function template, even though we're still writing recursive code.
</p>
<pre>
<code>
template &lt;class T, class... Rest&gt; 
void f(T&& t, Rest&&... r) 
{
    /* 
      handle one T 
    */
    static_if (sizeof...(r)) {
    /*
      handle the tail 
    */
        f(r...);
    }
}
</code>
</pre>
<p>
Mutually exclusive constraints would also be arguably easier to grok.
Instead of
</p>
<pre>
<code>
template &lt;class T, class... Args&gt; 
enable_if_t&lt;is_constructible_v&lt;T, Args...&gt;, unique_ptr&lt;T&gt;&gt; 
make_unique(Args&&... args) 
{
    return unique_ptr&lt;T&gt;(new T(forward&lt;Args&gt;(args)...));
}  

template &lt;class T, class... Args&gt;  
enable_if_t&lt;!is_constructible_v&lt;T, Args...&gt;, unique_ptr&lt;T&gt;&gt;
make_unique(Args&&... args) 
{
    return unique_ptr&lt;T&gt;(new T{forward&lt;Args&gt;(args)...});
}
</code>
</pre>
<p>
we could write
</p>
<pre>
<code>
template &lt;class T, class... Args&gt; 
unique_ptr&lt;T&gt;
make_unique(Args&&... args) 
{
    static_if (is_constructible_v&lt;T, Args...&gt;) {
        return unique_ptr&lt;T&gt;(new T(forward&lt;Args&gt;(args)...));
    } else {
        return unique_ptr&lt;T&gt;(new T{forward&lt;Args&gt;(args)...});
    }
}
</code>
</pre>
<p>
I expect there are many more good uses for such a facility than I can
imagine.
</p>

<a name="Concepts"></a><h2>Yes, but don't Concepts provide a superior alternative?</h2>

<p>
Yes, for expressing the constraints of a function template, they do. No, for
simplicity and locality of code, they don't. It's certainly easier to
write (mutually exclusive and other) constraints with concepts, since it's possible to overload
on concepts. The lack of locality remains, and the need to understand
overload resolution, partial ordering and SFINAE remains. I posit that
there are many simple cases where all that is still overly complex
when a simple block-scope static condition would do much better. Chances
are, of course, that combining Concepts with a static_if can lead to
expressive designs that are far superior to what either of these facilities 
can provide in isolation.
</p>
<p>
For the last part, it seems like some uses of static_if would combine
rather nicely with constraint disjunctions:
</p>
<p>
<pre>
<code>
template &lt;typename T, typename U&gt; void f(T, U)
  requires C1&lt;T&gt; && (C2&lt;U&gt; || C3&lt;U&gt;)
{
    static_if (C2&lt;U&gt;) 
    {
    } 
    else if (C3&lt;U&gt;) 
    {
    }
}
</code>
</pre>
