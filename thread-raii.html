<h2>Changes from previous version</h2>

<ul>
  <li>This paper revises P0206R0.</li>
  <li>Removed the motivation elaboration, it can be found in the previous revision.</li>
  <li>Removed the discarded solutions.</li>
  <li>Added explanation for the std::thread-accessing functions and discarded
    alternatives for it.</li>
  <li>Renamed safe_thread to joining_thread.</li>
  <li>Used thread::id and thread::native_handle_type in joining_thread.</li>
  <li>Updated proposed wording.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>
  C++ continues not to provide a thread type that would join() automatically
  on scope exit. This causes exception-safety problems, because failing to
  join() in all code paths causes the destructor of a std::thread to
  terminate(). This paper provides a solution that adds a new thread
  type that joins in its destructor, and is based on large-group and LEWG
  feedback given in Jacksonville. The proposal has been implemented and
  tested.

<a name="Solution2"><h2>Solution 2: Add a new thread type that auto-joins</h2>

<p>
  In a large-group discussion in Jacksonville, the outcome was that
  a new thread type that joins in its destructor should be added.
  The benefit of this solution is that it's non-intrusive; all existing
  users of std::thread are unaffected, for better or worse. Replacing
  the uses of std::thread with the uses of the new type where need be
  is arguably straightforward.
</p>

<a name="LEWGRecommendation"><h2>What LEWG recommended in Jacksonville</h2>

<p>
LEWG guidance from Jacksonville was as follows:    
</p>
<p>
  <ol>
    <li>The name of the type should not be "safe_thread", but LEWG had no consensus on which name to pick. There was no consensus between "joining_thread"
    and "simple_thread".</li>
    <li>The thread-accessing function that converts the new thread type to thread should not be a conversion operator, but rather a named function, with preference, but no consensus, for "as_thread" and "get_thread"</li>
  </ol>
</p>
<p>
  This paper provides a type named "joining_thread", with the thread
  conversion function "as_thread". The name "joining_thread" describes
  the functionality, and doesn't suggest that it's significantly simpler.
  While the author feels sympathy for it perhaps being, in many cases,
  simpler to use, the choice is based on more accurately describing
  what the type does. The author doesn't think that suggests that
  std::thread doesn't join, but since std::thread doesn't do a join
  in its destructor, the chosen name seems palatable. The choice
  of "as_thread" rather than "get_thread" is fairly arbitrary.
</p>

<a name="Accessor"><h2>The std::thread-accessing function</h2>

<p>
  In addition to picking the name "as_thread", this paper provides
  two std::thread-accessing functions:
</p>
<p>
  <pre><code>
    thread& as_thread(); // addition to std::thread interface
    const thread& as_thread() const; // addition to std::thread interface
   </code></pre>
</p>
<p>
  The functions are intentionally not ref-qualified, they intentionally
  return a reference rather than a value, and it's intentional that
  there are no overloads that return rvalue references.
</p>
<p>
  The lack of ref-qualified overloads is because of simplicity. Rather
  than having to write
</p>
<p>
  <pre><code>
    joining_thread make_joining_thread();
    joining_thread jt = make_joining_thread();
    thread t = std::move(jt).as_thread();
  </code></pre>
</p>
<p>
we can write    
</p>
<p>
  <pre><code>
    joining_thread make_joining_thread();
    thread t = std::move(make_joining_thread().as_thread());
  </code></pre>
</p>
<p>
However, we do not want to allow    
</p>
<p>
  <pre><code>
    joining_thread make_joining_thread();
    thread t{make_joining_thread()};
  </code></pre>
</p>
<p>
because that makes the conversion subtle. We also do not want to allow    
</p>    
<p>
  <pre><code>
    joining_thread make_joining_thread();
    thread t{make_joining_thread().as_thread()};
  </code></pre>
</p>
<p>
because that requires an overload that returns an rvalue reference
(complicating the type) and makes the ownership transfer subtle.  
</p>
<p>
  The lack of a direct way to return an rvalue reference from an
  joining_thread rvalue does disturb forwarding cases to some extent.
  That was deemed acceptable, because forwarding was seen as yet
  another case where ownership transfer is subtle.
</p>
<p>
  Finally, these are named functions rather than conversion functions.
  While conversion functions are more generic, it was deemed desirable
  that the conversion from a joining thread to a non-joining thread
  doesn't happen subtly in generic code.

  In [thread.threads]/1, insert as follows:
</p>
<p>
  </p><blockquote>
<pre>Header &lt;thread&gt; synopsis
  namespace std {
    class thread;
    <ins>class joining_thread;</ins>

    void swap(thread& x, thread& y) noexcept;
    <ins>void swap(joining_thread& x, joining_thread& y) noexcept;</ins>
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p></p>

<p>
  In [thread.thread.constr]/4, insert as follows:
</p>  
<p>
</p><blockquote>
  Remarks: This constructor shall not participate in overload resolution if <code>decay_t&lt;F&gt;</code> is the same type as <code>std::thread</code><ins> or if <code>decay_t&lt;F&gt;</code> is the same type as <code>std::joining_thread</code></ins>.

</blockquote>
<p></p>


<p>
  After [thread.thread.this], add a new section as follows:
</p>
<p>
  </p><blockquote>
<pre>Class joining_thread [thread.joining_thread.class]

namespace std {
  class joining_thread {
    public:
    // types
    typedef thread::native_handle_type native_handle_type;
    typedef thread::id id;
    // construct/copy/destroy:
    joining_thread() noexcept;
    template &lt;class F, class ...Args&gt; explicit joining_thread(F&amp;&amp; f, Args&amp;&amp;... args);
    ~joining_thread() noexcept; // semantics different from std::thread
    joining_thread(const joining_thread&amp;) = delete;
    joining_thread(joining_thread&amp;&amp;) noexcept;
    explicit joining_thread(thread&amp;&amp; x) noexcept; // addition to std::thread interface
    joining_thread&amp; operator=(const joining_thread&amp;) = delete;
    joining_thread&amp; operator=(joining_thread&amp;&amp;) noexcept; // semantics different from std::thread

    thread::id get_id() const noexcept;
    thread::native_handle_type native_handle(); // See 30.2.3
    thread& as_thread(); // addition to std::thread interface
    const thread& as_thread() const; // addition to std::thread interface
    // static members:
    static unsigned hardware_concurrency() noexcept;
  };
}
  
  
  
The class joining_thread provides the same facilities as thread, and
has the same members and the same semantics, with the differences
as described below.

joining_thread constructors [thread.joining_thread.constr]

explicit joining_thread(thread&amp;&amp; x) noexcept;

  Effects: Constructs an object of type joining_thread from x, and
  sets x to a default constructed state.

  Postconditions: x.get_id() == id() and get_id() returns the value
  of x.get_id() prior to the start of construction.
  
joining_thread destructor [thread.joining_thread.destr]

~joining_thread() noexcept;

  Effects: If joinable(), calls join(). Otherwise, has no effects.
  [Note: Because ~joining_thread is required to be noexcept,
  if join() throws then std::terminate() will be called.
  --end note]
  
joining_thread assignment [thread.joining_thread.assign]

joining_thread&amp; operator=(joining_thread&amp;&amp; x) noexcept;
  Effects: If joinable(), calls join(). Then, assigns
  the state of x to *this and sets x to a default constructed state.
  [Note: If join() throws then std::terminate() will be called.
  --end note]
  Postconditions: x.get_id() == id() and get_id() returns the value
  of x.get_id() prior to the assignment.

  Returns: *this
  
joining_thread&amp; operator=(thread&amp;&amp; x) noexcept;
  Effects: If joinable(), calls join(). Then, assigns
  the state of x to *this and sets x to a default constructed state.
  [Note: If join() throws then std::terminate() will be called.
  --end note]
  Postconditions: x.get_id() == id() and get_id() returns the value
  of x.get_id() prior to the assignment.

  Returns: *this

joining_thread members [thread.joining_thread.member]

thread& as_thread();

  Returns: A reference to the underlying thread object.

const thread& as_thread() const;

  Returns: A reference to the underlying thread object.
