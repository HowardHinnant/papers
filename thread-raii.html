<h1 align=center>Discussion about std::thread and RAII</h1>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>
  C++ continues not to provide a thread type that would join() automatically
  on scope exit. This causes exception-safety problems, because failing to
  join() in all code paths causes the destructor of a std::thread to
  terminate(). This paper explores various ways to solve the problem.

<a name="Problem"/><h2>The problem, reiterated</h2>
<p>
  Herb Sutter provided the following code example:
</p>
<p>
  <pre>
    <code>
      std::vector&lt;std::pair&lt;unsigned int, unsigned int&gt;&gt; partitions =
        utils::partition_indexes(0, size-1, num_threads);
      std::vector&lt;std::thread&gt; threads;

      LOG(LOG_DEBUG, "controller::reload_all: starting reload threads...");
      for (unsigned int i=0; i&lt;num_threads-1; i++) {
        threads.push_back(std::thread(reloadrangethread(this,
        partitions[i].first, partitions[i].second, size, unattended)));
      }

      LOG(LOG_DEBUG, "controller::reload_all: starting my own reload...");
      this-&gt;reload_range(partitions[num_threads-1].first,
        partitions[num_threads-1].second, size, unattended);

      LOG(LOG_DEBUG, "controller::reload_all: joining other threads...");
      for (size_t i=0; i&lt;threads.size(); i++) {
        threads[i].join();
      }      
    </code>
  </pre>
</p>
<p>
  The problem with the code is that the push_back can fail with an exception,
  and in general, any exception thrown will skip the loop that joins all
  threads, and any unjoined threads destroyed with the destruction of the
  thread vector will cause the program to terminate.
</p>

<a name="StatusQuo"/><h2>The status quo solution</h2>

<p>
  The way to make the code exception-safe is to use a third-party thread
  wrapper that joins the thread on destruction. That is, instead of containing
  threads, the vector should hold such wrappers. Scott Meyers,
  Anthony Williams and Bjarne Stroustrup
  all describe such thread wrappers in their most recent books.
</p>

<a name="StatusQuoProblem"/><h2>The problem with the status quo solution</h2>

<p>
  It's inconvenient to need to use a third-party wrapper for something
  as fundamental as exception-safety of using std::thread. There are multiple
  such third-party wrappers, and it takes more effort to take one of them
  into use than using a solution that would already be provided by the
  standard library implementation. The following sections enumerate some
  potential solutions.
</p>

<a name="Solution1"/><h2>Solution 1: Change std::thread::~thread to auto-join</h2>

<p>
  This solution has been previously proposed by Herb Sutter in
  <a href="http://open-std.org/JTC1/SC22/WG21/docs/papers/2013/n3636.pdf">n3636</a>. That paper contains proposed wording for the necessary changes to
  std::thread. Implementation is trivially easy for
  standard library vendors. As an addition, it's suggested that for
  audiences willing to use the current terminating semantics, a new type
  should be added that will not join on destructor, but will terminate instead.
</p>
<p>
  The opposition to this solution has been that it changes the semantics
  of existing code; there apparently are audiences who prefer the destruction
  of joinable threads (which can be seen a logic error) to terminate so that
  the program exits quickly, and external facilities can recover without
  the program waiting (or hanging on) a join().
</p>
<p>
  The benefit of this solution is that it's easy to use as a default. No
  external wrapper needs to be taken into use, and it's arguably a better
  default that caters better to non-expert use cases. Experts that want
  termination need to use an alternative approach, rather than non-experts
  who do not even realize their code isn't exception-safe needing to use
  an alternative approach.
</p>

<a name="Solution2"/><h2>Solution 2: Add a new thread type that auto-joins</h2>

<p>
  As opposed to adding a thread wrapper (see later), it's been suggested
  that it would be better to add a new thread type that has the full
  API of std::thread, and recommend using this new thread type instead
  of std::thread. Following such advise avoids the problems that would
  arise when using a thread combined with a thread wrapper; forgetting
  to wrap would make the exception-safety problems arise again.
</p>
<p>
  The benefit of this solution is that it's non-intrusive; all existing
  users of std::thread are unaffected, for better or worse. Replacing
  the uses of std::thread with the uses of the new type where need be
  is arguably straightforward.
</p>
<p>
  The downside of this solution is that it introduces another thread type
  that users will need to consider in addition to std::thread.
</p>

<a name="Solution3"/><h2>Solution 3: Add a thread wrapper that auto-joins</h2>

<p>
  The aforementioned book authors all provide a thread wrapper that
  joins in its destructor. The wrapper as such can be made fairly
  simple, and doesn't necessarily need to duplicate the full API
  of std::thread. It's non-intrusive for existing code that uses std::thread,
  and can be applied as necessary. It also doesn't need to duplicate all of the
  functionality in std::thread.
</p>
<p>
  The benefit of this solution is that it's non-intrusive; all existing
  users of std::thread are unaffected, for better or worse. The wrapper
  can be relatively simple, and can be specification-wise and
  implementation-wise
  a fairly lean solution. Replacing
  the uses of std::thread with the uses of the new type where need be
  can be straightforward.
</p>
<p>
  The downside of this solution is that remembering to use the wrapper
  is tedious. Another downside is that if it's really a wrapper, ownership
  questions arise; and if the wrapper owns the underlying std::thread,
  then there's no real difference between a new thread type and such a wrapper.
  Thus the 'wrapper' is NOT proposed with wording; the proposed wording
  for solutions for 1 and 2 ARE such wrappers; they own a thread, and
  are convertible from and to a thread.
</p>

<a name="SolutionSummary"/><h2>Solution summary</h2>

<p>
Solution 1 and Solution 2 are the same option from the point of view that
they both say "add a thread type that auto-joins." The only difference
between Solution 1 and Solution 2 is which type gets the std::thread name
- the one that has the current behavior, or the one that auto-joins. Also,
both solutions provide a "wrapper", as the new thread types proposed in
those solutions are convertible from and to std::thread.
</p>

<a name="Solution1Wording"/><h2>Wording for Solution 1</h2>

<p>
  This solution has been previously proposed by Herb Sutter in
  <a href="http://open-std.org/JTC1/SC22/WG21/docs/papers/2013/n3636.pdf">n3636</a>. That paper contains proposed wording for the necessary changes to
  std::thread, so this paper will not repeat that part of the wording.
  As an addition, this paper will
  provide wording for a new thread type
  should be added that will not join in destructor or assignment operator,
  but will terminate instead, thus providing a migration solution for users
  who want to retain the C++11 semantics that std::thread previously had.

  In [thread.threads]/1, insert as follows:
</p>
<p>
  <blockquote>
<pre>
Header &lt;thread&gt; synopsis
  namespace std {
    class thread;
    <ins>class basic_thread;</ins>
</pre>
</blockquote>
</p>
<p>
  After [thread.thread.this], add a new section as follows:
</p>
<p>
  <blockquote>
<pre>
Class basic_thread [thread.basic_thread.class]

namespace std {
  class basic_thread {
    public:
    // types:
    class id;
    typedef implementation-defined native_handle_type; // See 30.2.3
    // construct/copy/destroy:
    basic_thread() noexcept;
    template &lt;class F, class ...Args&gt; explicit basic_thread(F&amp;&amp; f, Args&amp;&amp;... args);
    ~basic_thread() noexcept; // semantics different from std::thread
    basic_thread(const basic_thread&amp;) = delete;
    basic_thread(basic_thread&amp;&amp;) noexcept;
    explicit basic_thread(thread&amp;&amp; x) noexcept; // addition to std::thread interface
    basic_thread&amp; operator=(const basic_thread&amp;) = delete;

    bool joinable() const noexcept;
    void join();

    thread to_thread(); // addition to std::thread interface
    // static members:
    static unsigned hardware_concurrency() noexcept;
  };
}
  
  
The class basic_thread provides the same facilities as thread, and
has the same members and the same semantics, with the differences
as described below.

basic_thread constructors [thread.basic_thread.constr]

explicit basic_thread(thread&amp;&amp; x) noexcept;

  Effects: Constructs an object of type basic_thread from x, and
  sets x to a default constructed state.

  Postconditions: x.get_id() == id() and get_id() returns the value
  of x.get_id() prior to the start of construction.
  
basic_thread destructor [thread.basic_thread.destr]

~basic_thread();

  Effects: If joinable(), calls std::terminate(). Otherwise, has no effects.
  [ Note: Either implicitly detaching or joining a joinable() thread in its
  destructor could result in difficult to debug correctness (for detach)
  or performance (for join) bugs encountered only when an exception is raised.
  Thus the programmer must ensure that the destructor is never executed while
  the thread is still joinable. -end note ]

basic_thread assignment [thread.basic_thread.assign]

basic_thread&amp; operator=(basic_thread&amp;&amp; x) noexcept;
  Effects: If joinable(), calls std::terminate(). Otherwise, assigns
  the state of x to *this and sets x to a default constructed state.

  Postconditions: x.get_id() == id() and get_id() returns the value
  of x.get_id() prior to the assignment.

  Returns: *this
  
basic_thread&amp; operator=(thread&amp;&amp; x) noexcept;
  Effects: If joinable(), calls std::terminate(). Otherwise, assigns
  the state of x to *this and sets x to a default constructed state.

  Postconditions: x.get_id() == id() and get_id() returns the value
  of x.get_id() prior to the assignment.

  Returns: *this

basic_thread members [thread.basic_thread.member]

thread to_thread();

  Postconditions: *this is set to a default constructed state. The state
  of the returned object is the state *this had prior to calling this function.

  Returns: A thread object initialized from *this.
  [Drafting note: an alternative approach would be to publicly inherit
  basic_thread from thread, and let derived-to-base conversion handle
  this conversion.]
